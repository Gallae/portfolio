        <p class="stationdifficulties">“Station Difficulties” is a campaign about a group of IT specialists who are hired by a local TV company to troubleshoot a grave problem. In recent weeks, a small local news station by the name of WKVB has had consistent issues with their broadcast during the 8 o’clock news. Viewers have called leaving complaints about disturbing images and sounds- videos of empty graves, screeching noises, public service announcements for disasters that never happened- right after the commercial break at 8:19 every night for about 3 weeks now. Nobody at WKVB has any idea what could be causing such glitches, but the viewers who have called to complain seem to be rather shaken by what they saw and heard coming from their screens. Thus, WKVB contacted and hired a number of different IT companies to help with their issues, to no avail. The channel doesn’t have unlimited funds- what independent news station in the rural Midwest does?- and as a result, they are running out of the money needed to both continue hiring IT contractors and continue broadcasting at all. Advertisers have begun pulling out of contracts with WKVB because they, too, have been receiving calls from irate and scared viewers about the disturbing imagery they have seen. The channel is desperate for help, and the players are their last hope at troubleshooting this glitch and saving the channel from sure bankruptcy.</p>
